Blockchain is a ground-breaking technology that has skyrocketed in popularity recently. It is a distributed, decentralised ledger that enables safe transaction recording without the use of middlemen. Double spending is a significant problem for blockchain technology, though, as it could endanger its security and legitimacy. The practise of using the same cryptocurrency more than once results in double spending, which is a fraudulent transaction. In this project report, we will explore the double spending problem in blockchain technology. We will delve into the technical aspects of the problem, including its causes and possible solutions. Furthermore, we will analyze the implications of double spending on the security and trustworthiness of blockchain networks. This report aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the double spending problem in blockchain and its impact on the broader ecosystem. We will also explore the current state of research in this area, including the latest techniques and approaches to address this problem. Finally, we will provide insights and recommendations for future research directions in this field. Overall, this report will serve as a valuable resource for individuals and organizations interested in blockchain technology and its potential applications.

The well-known double-spending problem in digital currency systems has been made worse by the development of blockchain technology. Double-spending is avoided in typical digital currency systems like PayPal and Venmo by a central authority that authenticates and verifies each transaction. However, there is no central authority in a decentralised blockchain network, and participants across the network validate transactions.
Participants in a blockchain network must concur on the legitimacy of each transaction and make sure the same digital currency unit is not used twice in order to prevent duplicate spending. This is accomplished through a consensus process, which can be in the form of Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake, among others.the process of creating a trust chain in a blockchain to prevent double spending. A double-spend issue occurs when a malevolent user pays money to another user and then, before that money is deducted from his account and spread throughout the network, conducts another transaction with it. The Trust chain a procedure to avoid this problem.

The objective of this project is to as we see the proof-of-work consensus model is an elegant method used by permission-less digital currencies like Bitcoin to deal with the double spending issue. Unfortunately, the need for a single, consistent global state cannot grow and necessitates extras like leaders or supervisory servers. The goal of all three blockchain technologies is to enable reliable transactions at scale. The issue is that, to yet, researchers have failed to develop and use a self-organizing mechanism to foster trust that is resistant to all known methods of attack. So, our objective is Double spending problem where we will Optimizing in transaction security and management.
